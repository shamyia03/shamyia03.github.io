<H2>Bio </H2>
<p>
    Hello! My name is Shamyia Banks and I am a junior computer science major at North Carolina Agriculture and Technical State University.  I am originally from Boston Massachusetts where I grew up in a house with both parents and four siblings. My mom was my biggest motivator. She made me try just about every extracurricular and from there I choose the few I wanted to stick with. It was clear early on that I was an athlete. I've been playing basketball and softball since I was 9 and continued on until my senior year of high school. I thought I would continue after high school, but I found another interest. I first was introduced to the tech field my senior year or high school. I took an elective computer science class and loved every second. By the end of the year my partner and I had created our own app. It was not perfect but it was the first of many I plan to create.
