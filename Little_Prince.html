    As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
    <p class="u1"> I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. </p>
    <p class="highlight"> It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</p>

    <p class="red"> "What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."</p>
And I felt him to be more fragile still.
<p class="u1"> I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</p>
