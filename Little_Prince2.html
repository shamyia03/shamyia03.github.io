    As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
    <span class="u1"> I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. </span>
    <span class="highlight"> It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span>

    <span class="red"> "What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible...‚Äù</span>
    As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again:
    <span class="red"> "What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."</span>
And I felt him to be more fragile still.
<span class="u1"> I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</span>
